Graceful degradation means creating web applications that function even when newer features arent supported, though with reduced capability. Service works support graceful degradation by letting web aps work even with slow, or even no, internet connection. If a user's browser doesn't support service workers, the app still works normally as long as there's a connection. But when service workers are supported, they allow offline access and faster loading through caching, which improves quality without breaking the experience for older environments.
